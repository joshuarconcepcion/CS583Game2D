Had trouble with pushing to Git since one of my files were really big apparently. If you have any questions about the files please let me know! I'm not sure if everything pushed properly but it seems so on my end :)

Here are the changes made from the one-pager:

- since hotpot is a very “throw everything into one pot”, there is not much actual food prep (like cooking, cutting, etc)
- no background sountrack, but there are sound effect
- instead of orders shown in bubbles, it’s is one large notepad with images of each ingredient they want
- no levels/timer; this game should be a relaxing game with no stress. i felt like doing levels overcomplicated everything. instead, there’s just an unlimited amount of customers and orders.
